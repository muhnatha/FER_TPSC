# Music Recomendation Based on Facial Expression
This projet is my final project for my university AI course. I built a music recommendation model based on your facial expression. There 4 expression, happy, sad, Neutral, and angry. You can  learn how I train the model 
on the Face_recognition_TPSC.ipynb file.
